Hello guys! 
Will we be on time for the launching of our new insurance product?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,640
Well, the validation of the product notice 
takes more time than expected...

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,080
How come? 
The blue print was provided 3 months ago!

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,520
Yes but many actors must align on the content.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,480
The business stakeholders, 
the partnership,  legal, ...

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,320
... actuarial, marketing, 
communication departments...

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,600
And this is just for Cardif side

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,479
...but you have the same 
on the Business Partner side on the commercial aspects...

9
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:33,760
I confirm: each single word, image or chapter 
has to be reveiwed...

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,559
and it implies many exchanges, discussions, comings and goings...

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,120
So, what is the lastest version 
of the working document?

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,480
You mean the one from the Cardif legal department 
or from the Partner marketing?

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,640
They are not on the same version ?!?

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,840
Well... I'm not sure they are dealing 
with the very last one

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,320
Let me check my emails, Jiras & Teams, 
with other scrum masters and product managers...

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,600
To be continued...
